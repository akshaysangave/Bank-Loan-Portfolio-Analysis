# Bank-Loan-Portfolio-Analysis
The Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis project analyzes loan data from a financial institution to uncover patterns in loan approval, funding, and repayment. Utilizing data analysis techniques, the project provides insights into the bank's loan portfolio, identifies key performance indicators, and offers recommendations for informed decision-making.
## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To analyze the distribution and characteristics of loan applications.
- To evaluate the funding status and repayment performance of the loans.
- To identify the key factors influencing loan approval and default rates.
- To provide actionable insights and recommendations for improving the loan portfolio's performance.
## Data Cleaning and Processing
The data cleaning and processing phase involved the following steps:
1. **Loading Data**: Imported the loan data from the provided dataset.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and treated missing values appropriately.
3. **Data Transformation**: Converted categorical variables into numerical formats and standardized date formats.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Detected and handled outliers in the dataset.
## Data Visualization and Analysis
To gain insights into the loan data, various data visualization techniques were employed:
- **Loan Amount Distribution**: Visualized the distribution of loan amounts to understand the range and central tendency.
- **Interest Rate Analysis**: Plotted the interest rates to identify patterns and trends.
- **Loan Status Distribution**: Created a bar chart to show the proportion of different loan statuses (e.g., Fully Paid, Charged Off).
- **Home Ownership and Loan Performance**: Analyzed the impact of home ownership on loan performance using a segmented bar chart.
- **DTI Ratio Analysis**: Examined the relationship between debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and loan default rates.
